# New project. 
This is my first project. Here, I've used the dataset from Kaggle, the link to which will be uploaded here. 
Here, I've taken the dataset of 'Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2022' and analyzed them accordgingly. 

I've plotted them with the help of matplot lib and represented it in the form of pie chart. 

So, that was it. More to it will be updated later.
